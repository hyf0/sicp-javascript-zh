The reason is that students with prior knowledge of the language are bound to make use of other features in their programs. Fellow students will legitimately ask the instructors about those features, and any answer will either frustate the student or lead to a tangent that is most likely not conducive to the learning objectives. This problem is especially severe for JavaScript, which is not known for its systematic design. Our solution to this challenge is radical: The Source Academy enforces the use of the respective Source language when the student clicks on a program of a particular chapter.
