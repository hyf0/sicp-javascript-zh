现在，我们已经见识了一些编程的要素：我们使用过基本的数学运算操作，然后将这些操作组合起来，并且通过声明复合函数来抽象这些组合后的的操作。但是，仅仅了解这些并不足以声称我们学会了如何去编程。我们现在的情况和刚学会如何移动国际象棋棋子的人一样，虽然了解基本的规则，但是对开局，策略，战术一无所知。和国际象棋初学者一样，我们还不知道编程领域中各种模式的用法。我们缺乏足够的知识去判断棋子的哪一步是值得的(哪一个函数值得声明)。我们缺乏足够的经验判断每一步的后果(比如，执行一个函数)。

The ability to visualize the consequences of the actions under consideration is crucial to becoming an expert programmer, just as it is in any synthetic, creative activity. In becoming an expert photographer, for example, one must learn how to look at a scene and know how dark each region will appear on a print for each possible choice of exposure and development <sup> [[1]]() </sup> conditions. Only then can one reason backward, planning framing, lighting, exposure, and development to obtain the desired effects. So it is with programming, where we are planning the course of action to be taken by a process and where we control the process by means of a program. To become experts, we must learn to visualize the processes generated by various types of functions. Only after we have developed such a skill can we learn to reliably construct programs that exhibit the desired behavior.

A function is a pattern for the local evolution of a computational process. It specifies how each stage of the process is built upon the previous stage. We would like to be able to make statements about the overall, or *global*, behavior of a process whose local evolution has been specified by a function. This is very difficult to do in general, but we can at least try to describe some typical patterns of process evolution.

In this section we will examine some common "shapes" for processes generated by simple functions. We will also investigate the rates at which these processes consume the important computational resources of time and space. The functions we will consider are very simple. Their role is like that played by test patterns in photography: as oversimplified prototypical patterns, rather than practical examples in their own right.
